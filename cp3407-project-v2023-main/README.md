# Design
*Yber Rent* is a website that allows users to register and put up listing of their cars to be rented. Other users of the site can see these listings and rent available cars. It can be thought of as AirBNB for cars. Users sign up for an account on the website and have permissions to create car listings. A merchant listing guide is also provided for users to follow, which acts as a template and also upholds the site's professional standard. After finishing the listing, an admin will review the post and verify that all the correct information is present. The posting will then be added with the users car linked to the *Yber Rent* Rentle platform, allowing for others to rent the car at the listed price.

# Version Control
During the development of the Yber Rent webpage, we recognized that the need for version control was minimal. Our approach differed from traditional web development; instead of writing HTML or PHP code from scratch, we opted for efficiency and chose WordPress as our platform. This allowed us to leverage the power of existing plugins and themes, saving time and resources. While code versioning wasn't a priority, our documentation deserved the best, and we turned to GitHub to maintain a thorough record of our processes and changes. For the more visual aspects of our Scrum and Agile development, we relied on Miro, ensuring that our collaborative efforts were well-organized and streamlined. This balanced approach allowed us to focus on delivering a user-friendly and visually engaging website while maintaining transparent and organized project management.


# Building and Development Tools
*Yber Rent* was developed using multiple different softwares and plugins, including:

* WordPress: The main software used to build the site. It's database system also acts as the foundation of our users login / account system. Wordpress has a large variety of plugins that add additional features or change how certain features work. Finally, WordPress comes with many different themes that overhaul the CSS of a site, changing it's look and appearance.
* Rentle: Rentle allows for our site's rental service, providing users with a timeframe to rent from, as well as handling transactions.
* User Registration: The User Registration plugin for WordPress streamlines the process of creating a user login system by providing a user-friendly interface and customizable features, enabling website owners to easily manage user registrations, profiles, and access control with efficiency and precision.
* WP Extended Search: The WP Extended Search plugin significantly enhanced the search feature by enabling it to detect tags on posts, thereby offering users a more comprehensive and accurate search experience, as it now includes tagged content in search results, improving content discoverability.
* Miro: We harnessed the power of Miro for visual collaboration and organization. Miro served as our digital whiteboard, allowing us to visually map out tasks, user stories, and sprint goals. It was an invaluable tool for assigning tasks to team members, tracking progress, and conducting sprint retrospectives. With its versatile canvas, sticky notes, and collaborative features, Miro streamlined our Scrum workflow, fostering transparency and enhancing our team's ability to plan and reflect effectively.
